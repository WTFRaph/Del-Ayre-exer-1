<hr />
<li><b>The Basics</b></li>
Valorant is a tactical shooter as it favors game sense, knowledge, and thorough planning to secure the win. But every game has the basics
and mastering the basics is always one of the keys to victory. The basics include:
<br />
<ol>
	<li>Shooting</li>
	<li>Moving</li>
	<li>Ability Usage</li>
</ol>
<br />
<b>1. Shooting</b>
<br />
The backbone of every shooter game, if you can't hit your shots you can' win the game. knowing how to shoot effecively can hhelp you with
 deciding how you play and the better you are at shooting, the better your plays will be.
<br />
<br />
<b>2. Movement</b>
<br />
Unlike other games, Valorant has a penalty when moving while shooting, so when learning movement, it is important to know when to stop and shoot and learn how to move around the map
 learning the fastest and effective routes to engage and/or disengage with the enemy.
<br />
<br />
<b>3. Ability Usage</b>
<br />
Each agent has their own unique sets of abilities that can help change the ide of battle, turning a losing position or pushing the advantage by either flashing
 to make the enemies blind to make it easier to kill them, smokes to deny lines of sight, and throwing explosives to fish out player or delay them.
<br />
<br />
<br />
After knowing the basics, how to win the game is simple. 10 players go into a map and pick their agents, each agent has a special role tide to them dictaing how they are played and wha they can bring into the team,
 2 teams 5 players each will now spawn in a randomized map in which they are placed on either side, Attackers or Defenders.
 <br />
<br />
Attackers are tasked to planting the bomb in 1 of 2, sometimes 3, bomb sites in which they either defeat all of tthe opposing members or let the bomb detonate winning the round.
<br />
<br />
Defenders, well, defend the bomb sites as their objective is to make sure tthe attackers don't get in by eliminating them or defusing the bomb before the timer runs out.
<br />
<br />
After 12 rounds the 2 teams switch sides and first to 13 wins the game.

	Team roles
</center>
</h2>
Having a balanced team is another key to victory as 1 agent simply cannot do it all, thus has to rely on others to fill in those gaps thus a heavy emphasis on the teamwork aspect of the game
<br />
<br />
<ul>
	<li><i>Duelists</i></li>
	<p> Duelists are self-suffiecient fraggers who their team expects, through abilities and skills, to get high frags and seek out engagements first</p>
